  How to Play – Antimatter Dimensions
  </div>
  <hr>
  <div style="text-align: center">
  Antimatter Dimensions is an Idle Incremental game with multiple layers of unlocks, prestige, and achievements. The basic Goal is to reach infinity and receive an infinity point, which can be spent on various skills to increase your overall production.

  <b>Dimensions:</b>
  <br>
  Dimensions are your production units in game.  The first Dimension produces your Antimatter.  Each consecutive dimension produces the previous one, allowing you to have steady growth. There are eight dimensions total.
  <br>
  <b>Dimension Multiplier:</b> Beside the dimension there is a multiplier (example: First Dimension x1.0). The base production of each dimension is multiplied by this number.  This multiplier increases by 2x(Base) for every 10 of that dimension purchased. Each time this occurs, the price of the dimension will increase.
  <br>
  <b>Accumulated Dimension Quantity:</b> The next column is your current amount of that dimension you own. This is a combination of how many you have purchased with antimatter, as well as produced from the higher dimension.
  <br>
  <b>Purchased Dimensions Quantity:</b>  Next to each accumulated quantity of owned dimensions, the amount of that dimension purchased toward the next multiplier upgrade is displayed in brackets.  If you have (4) next to your accumulated dimension quaintly, you will need 6 more of that dimension for the next multiplier increase.
  <br>
  <b>Dimension Growth Percent:</b>  This number represents the amount of growth that dimensions experiences per second. +100% means the dimension is doubling each second.  This allows you to judge overall growth.
  <br>
  <b>Cost & until 10:</b> You can buy a single quantity of each dimension with antimatter when the cost button is highlighted.  Alternatively, if the Until 10 buttons is highlighted, you can buy whatever quantity gets you to that dimensions next dimension multiplier.
  <br>
  <b>Max all:</b> Max all will buy max tickspeed (see below), then will buy until 10 of 8th dimension until it can't anymore, then 7th, and so on.
  <br>
  <b>Dimension base prices:</b> 10, 100, 10000, 1e6, 1e9, 1e13, 1e18, 1e24
  <br>
  <b>Base per 10 bought dimension price increases:</b>1000, 10000, 1e5, 1e6, 1e8, 1e10, 1e12, 1e15
      <br>
    <b>Hotkeys: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8</b> for buy until 10 []th dimension, <b>M</b> for Max all

  <button onclick='changestate(2)' class="storebtn">Ticks</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div2' class='hidden'>
  <b>Tick:</b> Production in the game happens on each “tick”.
  <br>
  <b>Interval:</b> The length of time between ticks. This is lowered by purchasing tick interval reductions.
  <br>
  <b>Cost:</b> The cost of antimatter for reducing the tick interval by the % displayed above (Without Galaxies your base tickspeed decrease is 11% per purchase)
  <br>
  <b>Buy Max:</b> This will buy the maximum amount of tick interval decreases available with your current amount of Antimatter.
  <br>
  Note that the actual tickspeed time is fake and the game always runs at 20 ticks per second.
  </div>
  <hr>
  <button onclick='changestate(3)' class="storebtn">Dimension Shift/Boost</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div3' class='hidden'>
  <b>Dimension Shift:</b> This resets your current game, but unlocks another dimension for your next run. Each one requires 20 (base) of your highest unlocked dimension.
  <br>
  <b>Dimension Boost:</b> A dimension shift, but you don't unlock a new dimension. This happens after 4 dimension shifts. Each one requires 20+(boosts*15) (base) eighth dimensions.
  <br>
  Each dimension shift and boost will provide a x2 (base) multiplier to first dimension, and each dimension after will have half (base) multiplier as the previous (min 1).
      <br>
    <b>Hotkey: D</b>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <button onclick='changestate(5)' class="storebtn">Antimatter Galaxies</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div5' class='hidden'>
  Purchasing an Antimatter Galaxy will reset your game back to the point where only 4 Dimensions are available, but will increase the effect of your tick speed interval reduction by 2%.
  <br>
  Though it will have very little impact for the first few purchases, the increase is multiplicative and won’t take long to be visible.
  <br>
  Your first galaxy will increase your tickspeed interval upgrade as if it were 10% originally, so you will have 12% after 1 galaxy.
  <br>
  Galaxies require 80+(galaxies*60) (base) Eighth Dimensions.
  <br>
    <b>Hotkey: G</b>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <button onclick='changestate(7)' class="storebtn">Dimensional Sacrifice</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div7' class='hidden'>
  You unlock Dimensional Sacrifice after your first dimensional boost.
  <br>
  Sacrificing will immediately reduce the owned quantity of dimensions 1 through 7 to zero. This does not reduce the multiplier or the current cost.  In return, it will multiply the Eighth Dimension Multiplier by the shown value. It will take time to get back to the production you previously had, but you will end up with a net increase.
  <br>
  <b>When should I Sacrifice?</b> Depends on your percentages (+%/s), but if they are over ~2% and the multiplier is over 2x, I'd say it's worth it. The lower the percentage, the longer it takes to gain back your dimensions.
  <br>
  <b>Dimensional Sacrifice Checkbox:</b> This allows you to complete dimensional sacrifices without having the warning popup.
  <br><br>
  The dimensional sacrifice formula (where n is the total amount of first dimensions you've had) is:
  <br>
  Base: (log(n)/10)^m, where m is 2 at base, 2.2 with the "The Gods are pleased" achievement, and 2.5 with the "Gift from the Gods" achievement.
  <br>
  Eighth Dimension Autobuyer Challenge: m^0.05/n^0.04*j, where m is the current number of first dimensions you have and j is your previous sacrifice multiplier.
  <br>
  After Infinity Challenge 2: n^m, where m is 0.01 at base and 0.011 with the "Yet another infinity reference" achievement.
      <br>

  <button onclick='changestate(8)' class="storebtn">Infinity</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div8' class='hidden'>
  Once you have too much Antimatter for the world to handle (2^1024, or 1.7976931348623159e308) you’ll reach infinity and be able to perform a “Big Crunch”.
  <br>
  Each Infinity completed will give an Infinity Point. These can be spent on upgrades in the new infinity tab. You must purchase these upgrades from top to bottom.
  <br>
  The "x2 IP from all sources" upgrade can be bought multiple times, but each purchase requires 10 times as much IP. You must buy all 16 previous infinity upgrades to buy the first level.
  </div>
  <hr>
  <button onclick='changestate(9)' class="storebtn">Achievements</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div9' class='hidden'>
  Each achievement has conditions that must be met before they are earned.  Some are very simple, and some are significantly trickier.  You may have to infinity or start a challenge before attempting some of the harder ones.
  <br>
  You will recieve a x1.5 multiplier to all dimensions for each completed row. In addition, some achievements have their own rewards.
  </div>
  <hr>
  <button onclick='changestate(10)' class="storebtn">Challenges</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div10' class='hidden'>
  Challenges are unlocked after first infinity; they change in-game mechanics in different ways to create more difficult infinity circumstances.
  <br>
  Each completed challenge will award an auto buyer.  You can run them multiple times (though only the first time grants a reward), and they can be exited at any time via the “Exit Challenge” button on the challenge tab.
  <br>
  The rightmost row of Infinity Upgrades does not work in challenges.
  </div>
  <hr>
  <button onclick='changestate(11)' class="storebtn">Autobuyers</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div11' class='hidden'>
  <b>Autobuyers:</b>
  <br>
  Autobuyers (awarded by completing challenges) allow the automatic purchase of dimensions, dimension shifts/boosts, galaxies, tickspeed interval decreases, Big Crunches, and Dimensional Sacrifice (later). They are located under the infinty tab in "Autobuyers".
  <br><br>
  <b>Priority:</b> Priorities tell the game which autobuyer will buy if two are affordable in the same tick. Priority 1 is bought 1st, Priority 2 is bought 2nd, etc. Two equal priorities will pick their buying order randomly. <!-- While you cannot set these, big crunch has a priority of 0, galaxies have a priority of 10, dimboosts 11, and sacrifice (once unlocked) 11. -->
  <br>
  <b>Autobuyer Speed:</b>The cooloff period before the autobuyer makes another puchase. This rounds up to the nearest 100ms, so 200ms and 101ms are the same speed.
  <br>
  <b>Bulk Buy:</b> Once the Speed of an Autobuyer is maxed, all future upgrades will double the amount the autobuyer purchases per tick. This can be disabled.
  <br>
  <b>Dimension Autobuyer Buy Quantity:</b> Autobuyers for dimensions can be set to buy a single, or until 10, on each cooldown. Bulk buy does not work when the autobuyer is set to singles.
  <br>
  <b>Tickspeed Autobuyer Buy Quantity:</b> The tickspeed autobuyer can be set to buy a single or the max available on each cooldown.
  <br>
  <b>Automatic Dimboost Customization:</b> With the Dimboost autobuyer you can set the max amount of 8th dimensions to use for the autobuyer, the amount of galaxies before dimboosts are always autopurchased, and (when unlocked) the ability to buy dimboosts in bulk (at a fixed amount).
  <br>
  <b>Max Galaxies:</b> The highest amount of galaxies the galaxies autobuyer will buy.
  <br>
  <b>IP on crunch:</b> Once you break Infinity, you can set how many IP you would like to wait for before crunching. It accepts e notation (12.34e5 is 1234000).
  <br>
  <b>Sacrifice Autobuyer:</b> This autobuyer has a maxed timer from the start. You can set how much multiplier it waits for before sacrificing. It accepts e notation.
  <br>
  The double autobuyer tick speed upgrade will have all autobuyers buy twice as fast.<br>
    <b>Toggle All Autobuyers:</b> This button will turn all of your autobuyers on or off. <!--say how it decides which?-->
      <br>
    <b>Hotkey: A</b> (for toggle all autobuyers)
  </div>
  <hr>
  <button onclick='changestate(12)' class="storebtn">Breaking Infinity</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div12' class='hidden'>
  Originally Antimatter Dimensions was restricted by "Infinity". Since a significant update, you can now "Break Infinity" once your Big Crunch autobuyer has been maxed. This opens up a selection of new upgrades as well as the ability to gain more than 1 infinity point per run.
  <br>
  <b>Fixing Infinity:</b>You can revert the breaking at anytime by clicking fix infinity.
  <br>
  <b>IP Gain Formula:</b>10^(log(current antimatter)/308-0.75)*bonuses
  </div>
  <hr>
  <button onclick='changestate(13)' class="storebtn">Infinity Dimensions</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div13' class='hidden'>
  <b>Unlocking Infinity Dimensions:</b>Infinity Dimensions are unlocked by reaching a certain amount of antimatter.
  <br>
  <b>Infinity Dimension Cost:</b>Infinity dimensions are only purchasable in sets of 10, and cost Infinity points.
  <br>
  <b>Infinity Dimension Production:</b>Similar to the original dimensions, each infinity dimension produces the dimension above it. Dimension 3 produce 2, 2 produces 1.  Instead of antimatter, Infinity Dimension produces Infinity power, which translates to an overall multiplier on all original dimensions.
  <br>
  Infinity Power gives a boost to all dimensions equal to (power^7).
  </div>
  <hr>
  <button onclick='changestate(14)' class="storebtn">Infinity Challenges</button>
  <div style="text-align: left" id='div14' class='hidden'>
  Infinity Challenges are like regular challenges, but they have higher end goals and are generally harder than regular challenges (but have a different kind of reward).
    <br>
  They unlock at set amounts of antimatter - the ones unlocking later are (generally) more difficult.
